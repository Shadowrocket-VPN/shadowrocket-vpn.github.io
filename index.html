<!-- What is Shadowrocket -->
<section id="about" class="section-padding">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="mb-4">What is Shadowrocket VPN?</h2>
    <p>
      Shadowrocket VPN is a professional proxy utility tool primarily available for iOS devices. 
      It allows users to route their internet traffic through secure servers using various proxy 
      protocols such as SOCKS5, HTTP, HTTPS, and Shadowsocks. Unlike traditional VPN apps that 
      offer one-click connection, Shadowrocket is designed for advanced users who want more control 
      over their network traffic and proxy rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application enables users to configure custom proxy servers, filter traffic based on 
      domain rules, and monitor real-time connection statistics. This makes it especially useful 
      for individuals who need flexible internet routing, developers who test different network 
      environments, and users who want to bypass censorship or geo-restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadowrocket acts as both a VPN client and a proxy manager. It encrypts traffic (depending 
      on configuration) and ensures that data traveling between your device and the server remains 
      protected from third-party interception. With increasing concerns about online privacy and 
      surveillance, tools like Shadowrocket have become essential for secure communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, Shadowrocket VPN is known for its speed, customization options, compatibility 
      with multiple protocols, and reliable performance, making it one of the preferred tools 
      for advanced VPN and proxy users.

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
          Shadowrocket VPN offers a wide range of powerful features that make it stand out 
          from standard VPN applications. Below are some of its most important features:
        </p>

        <h5>1. Multiple Proxy Protocol Support</h5>
        <p>
          Shadowrocket supports various proxy protocols including SOCKS5, HTTP, HTTPS, and 
          Shadowsocks. This allows users to choose the protocol that best suits their needs 
          in terms of speed and security.
        </p>

        <h5>2. Advanced Rule-Based Routing</h5>
        <p>
          One of the strongest features of Shadowrocket is its rule-based traffic management. 
          Users can configure domain-based routing rules, meaning certain websites can use a 
          proxy while others connect directly.
        </p>

        <h5>3. Real-Time Traffic Monitoring</h5>
        <p>
          The app provides detailed statistics about upload and download speeds, latency, 
          and data usage. This helps users monitor network performance efficiently.
        </p>

        <h5>4. Strong Encryption</h5>
        <p>
          When configured with secure servers, Shadowrocket encrypts internet traffic, 
          protecting sensitive data from hackers, ISPs, and malicious networks.
        </p>

        <h5>5. Geo-Restriction Bypass</h5>
        <p>
          Users can access region-locked content and websites by connecting to servers 
          located in different countries.
        </p>

        <h5>6. Lightweight & Fast</h5>
        <p>
          Unlike many heavy VPN apps, Shadowrocket is lightweight and optimized for performance, 
          providing stable and fast connections.

<section id="usage" class="section-padding">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="mb-4">What is Shadowrocket Used For?</h2>
    <p>
      Shadowrocket VPN is used for a variety of purposes related to privacy, security, and 
      internet freedom. One of the primary uses is bypassing geo-restrictions. Many websites 
      and streaming platforms restrict content based on geographic location. By connecting 
      to servers in different countries, users can access blocked content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another common use is improving online privacy. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) 
      often monitor browsing activities. By routing traffic through a secure proxy or VPN 
      tunnel, users can hide their browsing history from third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadowrocket is also used for securing public Wi-Fi connections. Public networks 
      are vulnerable to cyber threats and data interception. Encrypted connections reduce 
      the risk of sensitive data theft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developers and technical users also use Shadowrocket for network testing and 
      debugging purposes. The ability to create custom routing rules and proxy 
      configurations makes it highly flexible for technical scenarios.

<!-- VPN vs Proxy -->
<section class="section-padding bg-light">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="mb-4">Difference Between VPN & Proxy Server</h2>

    <p>
      Many users confuse VPNs and proxy servers, but they function differently. 
      A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts all internet traffic from your device 
      and routes it through a secure server. This provides complete device-level protection.
    </p>

    <p>
      A proxy server, on the other hand, acts as an intermediary between your device 
      and the internet. It hides your IP address but may not encrypt traffic unless 
      configured with secure protocols.
    </p>

    <p>
      VPNs are generally more secure because they encrypt all data traffic, whereas 
      proxies are faster but offer limited security. Shadowrocket is unique because 
      it combines both VPN and proxy functionalities, giving users advanced flexibility.
